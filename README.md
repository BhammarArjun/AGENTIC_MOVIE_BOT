## 🔧 Under The Hood

Let’s be real —  
No fancy agentic libraries were used.  
Just **pure Python**, integrated with **Google Gemini via its SDK**. Everything — from RAG to memory handling — is done **locally**:

- 🗃️ **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- 🔍 **Vector Embedding Model**: `mxbai-embed-large:latest`  
- 🧠 **Vector Store**: Qdrant  
- 💾 **Memory Handling**: Maintains memory across multi-step conversations to give context-aware responses (smart move, huh?)

The real magic?  
**Data sourcing, cleaning, storing, and finally using it effectively.**  
This wasn’t a weekend hack — it spanned **weeks of effort**, exploration, and fun.
